  <p>Poole itself is just a static webpage, and doesn&#8217;t require any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the Github API for managing your repo&#8217;s contents.</p>

<p>The Github API is somewhat funky from time to time, and hard to debug. We had to be aware of CORS issues and properly setting up headers for authorization. What&#8217;s challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API (around trees and blobs), which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance. That&#8217;s why creating a good architecture was crucial to manage the complexity. I ended up in abstracting the data layer into a separate module, Github.js.</p>

<h2 id='githubjs'>Github.js</h2>

<p><a href='https://github.com/poole/github'>Github.js</a> is a higher-level wrapper around the Github API. It&#8217;s intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with Github from the browser. It supports reading, writing, renaming and deleting files. Goal was to have a simple data abstraction layer, nothing to fancy, but providing exactly the operations we need.</p>

<h2 id='gatekeeper'>Gatekeeper</h2>

<p>Because of some <a href='http://blog.vjeux.com/2012/javascript/github-oauth-login-browser-side.html'>security-related limitations</a>, Github prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application.</p>

<p>This is a real bummer. So we built <a href='http://github.com/developmentseed/gatekeeper'>Gatekeeper</a>, which is the missing piece you need in order to make OAuth work.</p>

<h1 id='installation'>Installation</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Fork and clone the repo in order to run your own instance of Poole.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Setup a Github application, so CORS requests are possible as well as OAuth authentication.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Setup Gatekeeper.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions here and fill in the information that is provided after registering a new Github Application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Adjust <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>auto: true
server: true
oauth_client_id: your_oauth_client_id
gatekeeper_url: http://gatekeeper.example.com
exclude:
- .gitignore
- README.md</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Run it.</p>

<pre><code>server:poole poole$ jekyll</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id='limitations'>Limitations</h1>

<p>The Github API comes with a number of limitations because of its low-level nature. Here is a the list of known issues related to that. I hope the folks at Github can help us (with some minor additions to their API) so we can eliminate them.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Listing Repositories</p>

<p>When listing the repositories, we can&#8217;t determine which of them are actual Jekyll sites. Theoretically we could, by issuing a separate request that fetches repository information (such as branches) and looks for a <code>_config.yml</code> file. However this is way to slow, so we have to do it on-demand as you click on a repository.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Organizations</p>

<p>Repositories that live within your organizations can only be accessed by entering the url (<code>/:organization/:repo/:branch</code>) manually.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Deleting and renaming files</p>

<p>This requires a full tree to be written involving a new commit that points to that tree. In fact this is not a big problem with small repositories, but once they get bigger it&#8217;s not only a performance issue, you&#8217;ll get errors. Be aware that you may not (yet) be able to rename or delete files when working with bigger repositories.</p>
